      <h1>Examination of Rupture</h1>
      <div>
        <img src='Image3.jpg' alt="Achilles Tendon Rupture" class='right'>
        <p>A doctor will asses your symptoms as well as your medical history and injury mechanism, to check the most likely result of your pain. They will likely asses the movemtn in your foot. They could also use either ultrasound or an MRI scan to see if you have a partial or complete tear.</p>
        <p>The Thompson test for Achilles Tendon Rupture is widely used by practioners, and can be done at home if you would like to check for yourself.</p>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide to the Thompson Test</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Lie face down on a bed, making sure you feet are over the edge.</li>
          <li>Get your friend to squeeze the calf on the injured leg.</li>
          <li>If your Achilles is ruptured, there will be little or no movement in the foot.</li>
        </ol>
      </div> 
    
      <h1>Management of Rupture</h1>
      <div>
          <h4>Non-surgical Treatment</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
              <li>You will be put into either a plaster cast or boot for your lower leg for around 6-8 weeks.</li>
              <li>The idea of this is to keep you tendon still whilst it heals</li>
              <li>The angle of the cast or boot will be changed over the time by the doctor in order to ensure the tendon hels correctly</li>
              <li>It is important during this time to keep the weight off your ankle so it is likley you will be given crutches to keep you mobile, but your ankle is still kept rested</li>
              <li>This is the best option for you if you aren't very active as it will get you bsck to work and walking relatively quickly, however it increases the risk of the tendon rupturing again.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Surgical Repair</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <img src='Image4.jpg' alt="Achilles Tendon Rupture" class='right'>
            <li>It is most likley you will be advised to have surgery if you are young and active as it gives you less chance of re-injury.</li>
            <li>The surgeon will stitch the 2 ends of the ruptured tendon back together.</li>
            <li>If the tendon has detached from the calcaneus (the ankle bone), then the surgeon will drill a whole into the bone and attach the tendon back to the bone.</li>
            <li>Post-Surgery you will be placed in a cast or boot and similar changes will be made to the angle as if you had non-surgical treatment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Surgical vs non-surgical treatment<sup>1</sup>:</h4>
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>It has been shown that surgical and non-surgical treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture have a similar effect on the performance of  healed rupture</li>
                <li>However surgical repair restored the strength of the calf at 18 months post sugery</li>
                <li>For you this means that you have a better 'health-related quality of life' than having non-surgical treatment</li>
              </ul>
