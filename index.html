        <h1>Achilles Tendon Rupture</h1>
        <p>An achilles tendon rupture occurs when the tissue between your heael and your calf tears. There are 2 types of rupture; partial or complete tear. You will struggle to walk or even be unable to walk, depending on the severity you will need surgery to repair the tear. Although it can occur at any age; it is more common for 30-50 year olds.<p>

      <h2>Symptoms and Signs</h2>
      <br>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>You could feel a sudden onset pain in the ankle or calf area.</li>
          <li>You may hear a 'pop' sound at the time of the rupture.</li>
          <li>The heel area will become swollen and bruised.</li>
          <li>You will struggle to walk properly.</li>
          <li>You could be able to feel a defect in the tendon.</li>
          <li>You will struggle to point and lift your toes.</li>
          <li>While walking your foot will hang down and won't be able to be lifted easily.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Examiner squeezes the calf muscle.</li>
          <li>In a normal person it should cause the foot to plantarflex. In a patient with Achilles tendon rupture, the foot will not raise.</li>

        <h2>Management of Rupture</h2>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>There are 2 options of surgery depending on how the tendon has ruptured</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the tendon has ruptured in the middle the surgeon will sew the 2 ends of the ruptured tendon back together.</li>
              <li>If the tendon has detached from the calcaneus (the ankle bone), then the surgeon will drill a whole into the bone and attach the tendon back to the bone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Surgical or non-surgical treatment<sup>1</sup>:
            	<ul>
            		<li>It has been shown that surgical and non-surgical treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture have a similar effect on the performance of  healed rupture</li>
            		<li>However surgical treatment restored the strength of the calf at 18 months post sugery</li>
            		<li>For you this means that you have a better 'health-related quality of life' than having non-surgical treatment</li>
            	</ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Rest: It is important post operation to rest well to allow the body to recover, listen to your body, if it is hurting give it chance to rest</li>
              <li>A boot similar to the one pictured or a cast will be used for up to 12 weeks to maintain the foots position and take the pressure off the joint. If a boot is used, it will initally be placed plantarflexed (with the toes pointed) and will slowly be moved to a neutral foot position</li>
              <li>Movement in the joint will reduce swelling, but will also inpove strength of the ruptured achilles tendon, although it is important not to over-do anything. </li>
